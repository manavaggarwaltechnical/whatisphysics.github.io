    <h2>What is physics?</h2>
    <p>
      Physics is the greatest subjects i had ever seen.Physics is a branch of
      science. It is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines. The
      main goal of physics is to explain how things move in space and time and
      understand how the universe behaves. It studies matter, forces and their
      effects. The word physics comes from the Greek word ἡ φύσις, meaning
      "nature".[1] Physics can also be defined as "that department of knowledge
      which relates to the order of nature, or, in other words, to the regular
      succession of events".[2] Astronomy, a part of physics, is the oldest
      natural science. In the past it was a part of 'natural philosophy' with
      other fields of science, such as chemistry and biology. During the
      scientific revolution, these fields became separate, and physics became a
      distinct field of knowledge. Physics is very important in the development
      of new technologies, such as airplanes, televisions, computers and nuclear
      weapons. Mechanics, a branch of physics, helped develop the mathematical
      field of calculus. Modern physics connects ideas about the four laws of
      symmetry and conservation of energy, momentum, charge, and parity.

      astronomy Astronomy is the oldest natural science. The Sumerians, and
      Ancient Egyptians studied the stars, mostly with a view to prediction and
      religion. The first Babylonian star maps date from about 1200 BC. That
      astronomical events are periodic also dates back to the Babylonians.[3]
      Their understanding was not scientific, but their observations influenced
      later astronomy. Much astronomy came from Mesopotamia, Babylonia, Ancient
      Egypt, and Ancient Greece. Astronomers from Egypt built monuments that
      showed how objects in the sky moved, and most of the names for the
      constellations in the Northern hemisphere came from Greek astronomers.
      Natural philosophy Natural philosophy started in Greece around 650 BC when
      a movement of philosophers replaced superstition with naturalism, which
      refuted the spiritual. Leucippus and his student Democritus suggested the
      idea of the atom around this period. Physics in the medieval Islamic world
      Islamic scholars continued to study Aristotelian physics during the
      Islamic Golden Age. One main contribution was to observational astronomy.
      Some, like Ibn Sahl, Al-Kindi, Ibn al-Haytham, Al-Farisi and Avicenna,
      worked on optics and vision. In The Book of Optics, Ibn al-Haytham
      rejected previous Greek ideas concerning vision and proposed a new theory.
      He studied how light enters the eye, and developed the camera obscura.
      European scientists later built eyeglasses, magnifying glasses,
      telescopes, and cameras from this book. Classical physics Physics became a
      separate field of study after the scientific revolution.[4] Galileo's
      experiments helped to create classical physics. Although he did not invent
      the telescope, he used it when he looked into the night sky. He supported
      Copernicus' idea that the Earth moved around the Sun (heliocentrism). He
      also investigated gravity. Isaac Newton used Galileo's ideas to create his
      three laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation. Together these
      laws explained the motion of falling bodies near the earth and the motion
      of earth and planets around the sun.[5] In a couple centuries, the
      Industrial Revolution was in full swing and many more discoveries were
      made in many fields of science. The laws of classical physics are good
      enough to study objects that move much slower than the speed of light, and
      are not microscopic. When scientists first studied quantum mechanics, they
      had to create a new set of laws, which was the start of modern physics.
      Modern physics As scientists researched particles, they discovered what
      classical mechanics could not explain. Classical mechanics predicted that
      the speed of light varied, but experiments showed the speed of light
      stayed the same. This was predicted by Albert Einstein's theory of special
      relativity. Einstein predicted that the speed of electromagnetic radiation
      through empty space would always be the same. His view of space-time
      replaced the ancient idea that space and time were quite separate things.
      Max Planck came up with quantum mechanics to explain why metal releases
      electrons when you shine a light at it, and why matter emits radiation.
      Quantum mechanics applies for very small things like the electrons,
      protons, and neutrons that make up an atom. People like Werner Heisenberg,
      Erwin Schrödinger, and Paul Dirac continued to work on quantum mechanics
      and eventually we got the Standard Model.[6][7] Definition Physics is the
      study of energy and matter in space and time and how they are related to
      each other. Physicists assume the existence of mass, length, time and
      electric current and then define (give the meaning of) all other physical
      quantities in terms of these basic units. Mass, length, time, and electric
      current are never defined but the standard units used to measure them are
      always defined. In the International System of Units (abbreviated SI from
      the French Système International), the kilogram is the basic unit of mass,
      the metre is the basic unit of length, the second is the basic unit of
      time, and the ampere is the basic unit of electric current. In addition to
      these four units, there are three other ones: the mole, which is the unit
      of the quantity of matter, the candela which measures the luminous
      intensity (the power of lighting) and the kelvin, the unit of temperature.
      Physics studies how things move, and the forces that make them move. For
      example, velocity and acceleration are used by physics to show how things
      move. Also, physicists study the forces of gravity, electricity, magnetism
      and the forces that hold things together. Physics studies very large
      things, and very small things. For instance, physicists can study stars,
      planets and galaxies but could also study small pieces of matter, such as
      atoms and electrons.They may also study sound, light and other waves. As
      well as that, they could examine energy, heat and radioactivity, and even
      space and time. Physics not only helps people understand how objects move,
      but how they change form, how they make noise, how hot or cold they will
      be, and what they are made of at the smallest level. In short, physics is
      the branch of science that deals with properties of matter and energy
      along with the interaction between them. Physics and mathematics Physics
      is a quantitative science because it is based on measuring with numbers.
      Mathematics is used in physics to make models that try to predict what
      will happen in nature. These predictions are compared to the way the real
      world works. Physicists are always working to make their models of the
      world better. Branches Classical mechanics contains major topics such as
      Newton's laws of motion, Lagrangian mechanics, Hamiltonian mechanics,
      kinematics, statics, dynamics, chaos theory, acoustics, fluid dynamics,
      continuum mechanics. Classical mechanics is all about forces acting on a
      body in nature, balancing forces, maintaining equlibrium state, etc .
      Electromagnetism is study of charges on a particular body. It contains
      subtopics such as Electrostatics, electrodynamics, electricity, magnetism,
      magnetostatics, Maxwell's equations, optics . Thermodynamics and
      statistical mechanics are related with temperature. It includes main
      topics such as Heat engine, kinetic theory. It uses terms such as heat(Q),
      work(W), and internal energy (U). First law of thermodynamics gives us the
      relation them by the following equation (ΔU = Q − W) Quantum mechanics is
      the study of particle at the atomic level taking into consideration the
      atomic model. It includes subtopics Path integral formulation, scattering
      theory, Schrödinger equation, quantum field theory, quantum statistical
      mechanics. Relativity Advanced knowledge General description Physics is
      the science of matter and how matter interacts. Matter is any physical
      material in the universe. Everything is made of matter. Physics is used to
      describe the physical universe around us, and to predict how it will
      behave. Physics is the science concerned with the discovery and
      characterization of the universal laws which govern matter, movement and
      forces, and space and time, and other features of the natural world.
      Breadth and goals of physics The sweep of physics is broad, from the
      smallest components of matter and the forces that hold it together, to
      galaxies and even larger things. There are only four forces that appear to
      operate over this whole range. However, even these four forces (gravity,
      electromagnetism, the weak force associated with radioactivity, and the
      strong force which holds protons and neutrons in an atom together) are
      believed to be different parts of a single force. Physics is mainly
      focused on the goal of making ever simpler, more general, and more
      accurate rules that define the character and behavior of matter and space
      itself. One of the major goals of physics is making theories that apply to
      everything in the universe. In other words, physics can be viewed as the
      study of those universal laws which define, at the most basic level
      possible, the behavior of the physical universe. Physics uses the
      scientific method Physics uses the scientific method. That is, data from
      experiments and observations are collected. Theories which attempt to
      explain these data are produced. Physics uses these theories to not only
      describe physical phenomena, but to model physical systems and predict how
      these physical systems will behave. Physicists then compare these
      predictions to observations or experimental evidence to show whether the
      theory is right or wrong. The theories that are well supported by data and
      are especially simple and general are sometimes called scientific laws. Of
      course, all theories, including those known as laws, can be replaced by
      more accurate and more general laws, when a disagreement with data is
      found.[8] Physics is quantitative Physics is more quantitative than most
      other sciences. That is, many of the observations in physics may be
      represented in the form of numerical measurements. Most of the theories in
      physics use mathematics to express their principles. Most of the
      predictions from these theories are numerical. This is because of the
      areas which physics has addressed work better with quantitative approaches
      than other areas. Sciences also tend to become more quantitative with time
      as they become more highly developed, and physics is one of the oldest
      sciences. Fields of physics Classical physics normally includes the fields
      of mechanics, optics, electricity, magnetism, acoustics and
      thermodynamics. Modern physics is a term normally used to cover fields
      which rely on quantum theory, including quantum mechanics, atomic physics,
      nuclear physics, particle physics and condensed matter physics, as well as
      the more modern fields of general and special relativity, but these last
      two are often considered fields of classical physics as they do not rely
      on quantum theory. Although this difference can be found in older
      writings, it is of little new interest as quantum effects are now
      understood to be of importance even in fields that before were called
      classical. Approaches in physics There are many ways to study physics, and
      many different kinds of activities in physics. The two main types of
      activities are the collection of data, and the development of theories.
      Some subfields of physics can be studied by experiment. For example,
      Galileo Galilei invented kinematics by making experiments and studying the
      data. Experimental physics focuses mainly on an empirical approach. Some
      experiments are done to explore nature, and other experiments are
      performed to produce data to compare with the predictions of theories.
      Some other fields in physics like astrophysics and geophysics are mostly
      observational sciences because most of their data has to be collected
      passively instead of through experimentation. Galileo, for example, could
      only look at Jupiter and discover that it has moons. However,
      observational programs in these fields use many of the same tools and
      technology that are used in the experimental subfields of physics.
      Theoretical physics often uses quantitative approaches to develop the
      theories that attempt to explain the data. In this way, theoretical
      physicists often use tools from mathematics. Theoretical physics often can
      involve creating quantitative predictions of physical theories, and
      comparing these predictions quantitatively with data. Theoretical physics
      sometimes creates models of physical systems before data is available to
      test and support these models. These two main activities in physics, data
      collection, theory production and testing, use many different skills. This
      has led to a lot of specialization in physics, and the introduction,
      development and use of tools from other fields. For example, theoretical
      physicists use mathematics and numerical analysis and statistics and
      probability and computer software in their work. Experimental physicists
      develop instruments and techniques for collecting data, using engineering
      and computer technology and many other fields of technology. Often the
      tools from these other areas are not quite appropriate for the needs of
      physics, and need to be changed or more advanced versions have to be made.
      It is frequent for new physics to be discovered if experimental physicists
      do an experiment that current theories cannot explain, or for theoretical
      physicists to generate theories which can then be put to the test by
      experimental physicists. Experimental physics, engineering and technology
      are related. Experiments often need specialized tools such as particle
      accelerators, lasers, and important industrial applications such as
      transistors and magnetic resonance imaging have come from applied
      research. Physicists Prominent physicists Galileo Galilei (1564–1642)
